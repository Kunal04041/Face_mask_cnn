Face Mask Detection

The Face Mask Detection project leverages deep learning to create a convolutional neural network (CNN) model capable of detecting whether individuals are wearing face masks. In response to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Using TensorFlow and Keras designed and trained a CNN architecture that achieved high accuracy in distinguishing masked from unmasked faces.The deployed project accepts image as an input and predicts whether the person is wearing mask or not.
